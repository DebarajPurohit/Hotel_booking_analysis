# Hotel_booking_analysis
Here I am analysing 2 years of hotel booking data. Each row in the data set contains information of 1 booking happened in a specified date. There are more than 1 lakh rows of data. I have performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset and visualize verious insights using python libraries like seaborn and matplotlib.
